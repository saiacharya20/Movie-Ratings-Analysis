# Movie-Ratings-Analysis
This Project was a part of my Data Science internship at Cloud Counselage Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. We were given some raw data which had to be preprocessed and merged to extract relevent information from it. I have used Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to process the data and matplotlib to visualize the data for better understanding.
